    <h1>Anji Reddy Light Opera</h1>
    
    <h2>Iolanthe</h2>
    
    <h3>Act 1, Scene - An Arcadian Landscape</h3>
    
    <h4>LEI.</h4>
    <p>Think of the damp! And her chest was always delicate.</p>
    
    <h4>QUE.</h4>
    <p>And the frogs! Ugh! I never shall enjoy any peace of mind until I know why Iolanthe went to live among the frogs!</p>
    
    <h4>FLE.</h4>
    <p>Then why not summon her and ask her?</p>
    
    <h4>QUE.</h4>
    <p>Why? Because if I set eyes on her I should forgive her at once!</p>
    
    <h4>CEL.</h4>
    <p>Then why not forgive her? Twenty-five years—it's a long time!</p>
    
    <h4>LEI.</h4>
    <p>Think how we loved her!</p>
    
    <h4>QUE.</h4>
    <p>Loved her? What was your love to mine? Why, she was invaluable to me! Who taught me to curl myself inside a buttercup? Iolanthe! Who taught me to swing upon a cobweb? Iolanthe! Who taught me to dive into a dewdrop—to nestle in a nutshell—to gambol upon gossamer? Iolanthe!</p>
    
    <h4>LEI.</h4>
    <p>She certainly did surprising things!</p>
    
    <h4>FLE.</h4>
    <p>Oh, give her back to us, great Queen, for your sake if not for ours!</p>
    
    <p><em>(All kneel in supplication.)</em></p>
    
    <h4>QUE.</h4>
    <p><em>(irresolute)</em></p>
    <p>Oh, I should be strong, but I am weak! I should be marble, but I am clay! Her punishment has been heavier than I intended. I did not mean that she should live among the frogs—and—well, well, it shall be as you wish—it shall be as you wish!</p>
